###Once at hackathon (app is not finished) ....
The main idea of this app - receive posts from others users only if he is subscribed to some topic.
User can create own topics as well as create subscriptions of others users topics.
This app require web-server implementation, since another guy worked on it and not sure if sources are on git.
